    <b>Alternate Alerts</b> is a mass messaging system that delivers messages to a list of members quickly and reliably through Email, SMS or Voice. This allows an organization to have dispatches/alerts delivered to your Cell, Home or Work phone. You can also have it delivered to an email address.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Alternate Alerts</b> is the perfect companion to the Emergency departments paging/dispatch system. With Alternate Alerts you can rest assured that no matter where you are, or whether you forgot your pager at home, or if your pager battery runs dead you will get your calls.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Alternate Alerts</b> can be customized to meet any department’s needs. Alternate Alerts can be setup as a standalone system for a single department, or we can work with a dispatch center to cover entire counties. Alternate Alerts is completely autonomous and requires no additional steps from dispatchers. It records, uploads and distributes the dispatch to the members quickly and reliably. Each member can login to their profile online and customize their options that include delivery methods, blackout periods, email address and more.
